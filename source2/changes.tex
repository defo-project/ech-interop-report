\section{Document Versions}
\label{app:versions}

As stated, we plan to update this report from time to time and versioning
is based on the build time. This appendix notes the major changes between
``published'' versions.

\begin{itemize}

\item 2024-12-16: This was the 1st version of the report.

\item 2025-01-05: A version that just extends the run time for Table
    \ref{tab:itests} up to 2024-12-30 - on 2024-12-31 our chromium and Firefox
        tests started to fail. This was due to ``/tmp'' being full as some
        temporary files generated during tests weren't always being deleted.

\item 2025-09-04: Work started on an updated version of the report - we'll call
    the result of that work (when done) ``Version 2''.

\end{itemize}

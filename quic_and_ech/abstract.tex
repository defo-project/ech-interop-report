    Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) is a privacy-enhancement for the Transport Layer
    Security (TLS) protocol that underlies all web security and the security of
    many other Internet protocols. While the specification for ECH is relatively mature,
    (though not yet an Internet-RFC), and while implementations are already widespread,
    work remains to ensure that a random client and server can successfully use ECH.

    QUIC is a transport protocol that enhances privacy and security for endpoints~\cite{rfc9000}, deployed by several major Internet providers, including Google, Apple, and Cloudflare~\cite{langleyQUICTransportProtocol2017}. Standardised in 2021, QUIC is increasingly replacing web stacks using the traditional Transport Control Protocol (TCP) for web browsing.

    To that end, this report describes issues with ECH-enabling QUIC as an 
    input to future work on that topic.
